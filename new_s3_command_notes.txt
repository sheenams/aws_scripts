#For the given project:
1. Find the pipeline manifest
: /mnt/disk13/genetics/archival/<PIPELINE>/<PROJECT>/settings_files/pipeline-manifest.csv
2. From that, we'll grab
* barcode_id
* assay
* sample_type

3. Assay needs to have 'v#' stripped off to become assay "bucket" name
4. Sample type containts 'HC' or 'HAPMAP'it is  a control (regardless of other types listed for this sample), everything else is "sample". 
5 Barcode id will require parsing in order to match fastq name, but IS "SAMPLE_ID" in s3.
